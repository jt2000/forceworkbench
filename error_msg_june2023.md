I'm been getting this error message while trying to use workbench over the past several days, would someone please check on it?

UNKNOWN ERROR: read error on connection to ec2-34-194-152-137.compute-1.amazonaws.com:6379

There are also others who have been having the same issue: (https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/405728/unknown-error-read-error-on-connection-to-ec2-34-194-152-137-compute-1-amazonaw)
